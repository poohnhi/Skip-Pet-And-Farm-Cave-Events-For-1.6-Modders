# Skip Pet And Farm Cave Events

## What's this?
This is a small content pack using Content Patcher for Stardew Valley 1.6 that straight up skipping Marnie's pet adoption event and Demetrius's farm cave event. No more unwanted, unskippable Marnie and Demetrius visits. Your farm cave will always be empty... with the downside of no cats or dogs.

## How can this be useful?

### For 1.6 modders

Since these events are unskippable, this mod is useful for modders who don't want to bump in Marnie or Demetrius when they leave the farm house to test their mods on a new save.

### For 1.6 players

You can let the game skip adoption event with this mod by setting "Always Skip Pet" to "On" in the config. This option is the default option. Don't worry, if you want to adopt a cat or dog later, you still can.

The farm cave will also be empty by setting "Always Skip Farm Cave" to "On". This option is the default option. Don't worry, you still can choose farm cave later.

If you finally want to adopt a pet, go to this mod's config and set "Always Skip Pet" to "Off" will let the event trigger again, but only if the adoption event was previously skipped by this mod.

To choose farm cave type, go to the config and set "Always Skip Farm Cave" to "Off" will let the event to trigger again, but only if the farm cave event was previously skipped by this mod.

You can also type debug ebi 65 into SMAPI console and press ENTER to play Demetrius's event and choose farm cave type again. If the event didn't trigger, try change to a different map first.

## Other info

- This mod won't affect save files that already picked farm cave or adopted a pet. Well, it shouldn't be. But if it did somehow, please report bug to me.
- This mod is for Stardew Valley 1.6 only. If you install this mod on 1.5.6 and below, it will do nothing.
- Stardew Valley 1.6 alpha is currently in public testing for modders to migrate their mods. Beware that there is no new content in the alpha testing to avoid spoilers. Stardew Valley Discord server will have more information on this.
- I will try to update the mod frequently to match 1.6 changes.
