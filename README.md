# Skip Pet And Farm Cave Events

## What's this?
This is a small content pack that straight up skipping Marnie's pet adoption event and Demetrius's farm cave event. No more unwanted, unskippable Marnie and Demetrius visits. Your farm cave will always be empty... with the downside of no cats or dogs.

## How can this be useful?
- Since these events are unskippable, this is useful for modders who don't want to bump in Marnie or Demetrius when they leave the farm house to test their mods.
- For normal players, you can now choose when to adopt a cat or dog whenever you want by typing `debug seenMail rejectedPet false` into SMAPI console and press ENTER. It will let the Marnie's event trigger again when you leave the farm house in the morning.
- The farm cave will be empty. To choose farm cave type again, type `debug ebi 65` into SMAPI console and press ENTER. It should play Demetrius's event again and let you choose farm cave type. If the event didn't trigger, try change to a different map first.
- This mod also won't affect save files that already picked farm cave or adopted a pet. If it did somehow, please report bug to me.
